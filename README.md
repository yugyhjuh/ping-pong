# 1 Player Ping Pong

**//game incomplete//:**
* Script adapted from a book: Unity Multiplayer Games by Alan R. Stagner
* Gameplay: player (both paddles) move using WASD or arrow keys, when the ball hits goal it moves back to the starting position and starts going in a random direction, boundary prevents the ball going out from the scene, the ball had rigid body hence physics applied (gravity disabled)
* Game purpose: to familiarise myself with C# and Unity
